# Transformer
In this repos, I will present the work of my project concerning the architecture of Transformer

# Abstract
Machine translation is constantly evolving. It has allowed the world to advance whether in the field of trade or business. it have mad made it easy for many tasks, and she was able to connect people from different countries with different languages.

The questions that arise about Transformer, why is this technology so special compared to previous ones ? Why did you create this architecture ? Are not the current architectures performing well ? What solutions does the Transformer bring ?
The Transformer achieved levels of quality and performance very high, surpassing those used by Google Translation and Facebook. They had bad deficiencies and were corrected by the Transformer, while offering much better results. 

The Transformer is based on a mechanism already used by older architectures, but better, called self-attention.
